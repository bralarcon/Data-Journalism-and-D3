          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Michael: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So..</p>

          <p>Michael: So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
            Jim: Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky. 
            Michael: Oh, that's a good idea.
            Dwight: Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
            Michael: Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends. </p>

          <p>Pam: What's wrong Michael?
            Michael: I got gum in my hair.
            Pam: You do.
            Michael: This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
            Dwight: You've got a ton of dandruff.
            Michael: OK, let me be.
            Jim: How'd you get gum in your hair?
            Michael: I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
            Jim: But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
            Michael: Kill me... right now.
            Pam: We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
            Michael: I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
            Jim: Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
            Pam: No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
            Michael: Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.</p>
